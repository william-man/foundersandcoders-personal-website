  interests:
    "Outside of this, I enjoy exploring technical hobbies like electronics and pc modding. I built a custom watercooling loop for my pc to reduce temperatures, noise and better performance as well as its aesthetics. I have also modded a mechanical keyboard, changing the switches and customising it for a better typing experience.",
  objective:
    "I am looking to transition into a career as a web developer because I find it interesting how I can combine my creativity and logical thinking to create something that helps others. In particular, I think it's incredible the ways web apps have been designed and evolved to simplify tasks and connect people in their daily lives. I am also intrigued by how data is collected and analysed behind many apps to improve the user experience and business operations. As a web developer, I would enjoy taking part in the design process and craft digital solutions that bring value to both individuals and organisations.",
