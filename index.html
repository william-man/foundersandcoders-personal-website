              I began my programming journey when I was in university with Python,
              initially engaging in small exercises and projects as a hobby. At
              one point, I contemplated a career in data science and delved into
              machine learning, learning about data grouping and manipulation.
              However, I soon discovered that my true passion resided in the
              process of building projects rather than working extensively with
              data.

                Outside of this, I enjoy exploring technical hobbies like
                electronics and pc modding. I built a custom watercooling loop for
                my pc to reduce temperatures, noise and better performance as well
                as its aesthetics. I have also modded a mechanical keyboard,
                changing the switches and customising it for a better typing
                experience.

            I am looking to transition into a career as a web developer because
            I find it fascinating how I can combine my creativity and logical
            thinking to create something that helps others. In particular, I
            think it's incredible the ways web apps have been designed and
            evolved to simplify tasks and connect people in their daily lives. I
            am also intrigued by how data is collected and analysed behind many
            apps to improve the user experience and business operations. As a
            web developer, I would enjoy taking part in the design process and
            craft digital solutions that bring value to both individuals and
            organisations.
